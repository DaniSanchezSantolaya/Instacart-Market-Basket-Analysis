# Instacart-Market-Basket-Analysis
Models used for the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis

Approach consisted on LightGBM model to predict if the user purchases again or not the product (treated as binary classification). I applied some feature engineering (Eg. Average reorder rate the product, number of consecutive orders that the product has been reordered, etc).
